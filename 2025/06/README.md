# Day 1

[The challenge description](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/6)

```sh
python3 p1.py < input.txt # last line is the answer
python3 p2.py < input.txt # last line is the answer
```

**Status:** Complete

## Remarks

Part 2 changes a lot the way the input is read, so my code is very different between part1 and part2. I suppose this is expected 😈. I blame python for not having the chomp operator like perl did, but that's ok. Mostly parsing, though.
