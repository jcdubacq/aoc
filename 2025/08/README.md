```sh
python3 p1.py 1000 < input.txt # last line is the answer
python3 p2.py < input.txt # last line is the answer
```

**Status:** Complete

## Remarks

I went in a remarkably wrong direction while trying to answer part 1 before realizing that half a million is, in fact, a small number that can be crunched via sheer computing power. I should retrofit the more elegant version of part 2 appartenance to the Jsets into part 1, but it's done now. I had thought that part 2 would be a finding a spanning tree or something. It did not.
