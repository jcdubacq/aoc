# Day 1

[The challenge description](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2)

```sh
python3 p1.py < input.txt # last line is the answer
python3 p2.py < input.txt # last line is the answer
```

**Status:** Complete

## Remarks
The challenge of part1 is mostly parsing, and so is part2. Maybe time could be shaved: part1 by going only through the half numbers in the range, part2 by going through the various subpieces lengths and using the same trick as in part1. However, the computation is really quick as is.
