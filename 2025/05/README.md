```

**Status:** Complete

## Remarks

I solved part2 before part1, so I had a long time preparing the necessary data structures for part1. Note that I solved this on day 6, because life happens to be busy at times.

I am pretty sur that there is a ton of enhancements to be done for a language like C (I use linear search instead of binary search), but the overhead of building trees in Python is just not useful for such a short computation.
