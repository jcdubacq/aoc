[The challenge description](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/20)

```sh
python3 p1.py < input.txt # last line is the answer
python3 p2.py < input.txt # last line is the answer
```

**Status:** Part1 displays a full simulation of the results. Part2 just had to let go completely of the exact strings and concentrate on their lengths. The leap of faith, somehow.
